Positioning :-
// Website logo is positioned.

Animations :-
// Two types of animations are introduced in this section
// Different animations are applied in header text and button
// Button designing with one special property – animation-fill-mode.

Transform properties :-
// Transform translate and scale properties are introduced.  

After and Before Pseudo class :-
After pseudo class just creates a dot like element (according to my findings) and when we give it some width, 
it becomes wider and it becomes like a line (in x-axis) and when we give it a height, then it becomes a thick line.

// backface visibility -- for animation problems ..
// After pseudo class I applied in the button and animated it beautifully.
